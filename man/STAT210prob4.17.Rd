\description{
This data is from an article in Nature Genetics where they studied gene
expression as a function of different treatments for leukaemia. The three
treatment groups are: mercaptopurine (MP) only; low-dose methotrexate (LDMTX)
and MP; and high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) and MP. Each group contained ten
subjects, and the responses from a specific gene are reported.
