\description{
Seafloor sediments from 12 different sites along the coast have been collected and
their prokaryotic composition estimated by amplicon sequencing and subsequent
bioinformatic analysis.
}
\details{
The column Environment indicates if the samples are from Natural or Polluted sediments.

All remaining columns are centered log-transformed relative abundances of
various prokaryotic genera. A large value means a larger abundance, i.e. the most
common genera have the largest values, and vice versa.
