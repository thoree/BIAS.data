these sires the annual milk production for eight of their daughters were
recorded.

The sire data sets have been used in STAT210 and other courses at NMBU over
several years. While this data set consists of observed milk production for
40 cows, the \code{SireHerd} data has 24 observations. \code{SireHerd} contains
information of what herd the cows belong to. \code{sires} and \code{SireHerd} do not
contain the same observations.
