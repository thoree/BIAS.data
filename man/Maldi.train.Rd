\title{Maldi.train: MALDI-TOF MS on Cow Milk}
\format{
A data frame with 180 observations (rows) and 6180 variables
(columns).

\tabular{llllr}{
\tab \bold{Columns} \tab \bold{Data type} \tab \bold{Description} \tab \bold{Values}\cr
\code{[,1]} \tab \code{Percent_milk} \tab numeric \tab The percentage of cow milk \tab (0 - 0.9631) \cr
\code{[,2:6180]} \tab \code{MSdata1...MSdata6179} \tab numeric \tab MS data for the milk samples \tab (-0.7317301 - 6.973974)
}

The variables with mass spectrometry data, \code{Maldi.train[, 2:6180]},
are a quantification of molecule “size” and “charge” in a sample.
For simplicity we may say that the size of molecules increases from variable
2 to variable 6180.The measurements are then the amounts of molecules of
different sizes. The method is used to separate proteins, peptides and other
ionizable compunds.

\usage{
Maldi.train
}
\description{
This data is from an article in \emph{Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory
Systems} about quantitative whole spectrum analysis with MALDI-TOF MS on
skimmed milk from cow, goat and ewe. MALDI-TOF is a mass spectrometry
technique used for identifying ionizable components, such as proteins and
peptides in samples. This is the data from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS)
on cow milk for four replicates of 45 different milk mixtures.
}
\details{
The Maldi data was split into this training data, which can be used to fit a
model, and test data that can be used to evaluate the model.

# Dimensions of the object
dim(Maldi.train)

# Plot one of the spectra
plot(Maldi.train[, 2], type = "l")

# Plot several spectra
matplot(Maldi.train[, 2:6], type = "l", lty = 1)
