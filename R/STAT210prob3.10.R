#' STAT210prob3.10: Electromagnetic Effects on Forearm Disuse Osteopenia
#'
#' An article in \emph{Bioelectromagnetics} describes a randomized,
#' double-blind, sham-controlled, feasibility and dosing study. They wanted to
#' determine if a common pulsing electromagnetic field (PEMF) treatment could
#' moderate the substantial osteopenia that occurs after forearm disuse. The
#' data in this data set are the percent losses in Bone mineral density (BMD)
#' measurements on the radius after 16 weeks for patients wearing the
#' active or sham PEMF transducers for 1, 2, or 4 hours per day.

#' @format A data frame with 20 observations (rows) and 4 variables (columns).

#' @details
#'
#' The subjects in the study were randomized into four groups after a distal radius
#' fracture, or carpal surgery requiring immobilization in a cast. Active or
#' identical sham PEMF transducers were worn on the distal forearm for 1, 2, or
#' 4 hours per day for eight weeks starting after cast removal ("baseline") when bone
#' density continues to decline. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone geometry
#' were measured in the distal forearm by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and
#' peripheral quantitative computed tomography. The data were constructed to
#' match the means and standard deviations read from a graph in the paper.
