#' STAT210example14.16: Tensile Strength of Paper
#'
#' A paper manufacturer was interested in the effect of three different pulp
#' preparation methods and four different cooking temperatures on the tensile
#' strength of the paper. The data shows the results of 36 runs in a factorial
#' experiment to test the tensile strength of the paper.

#' @details
#'
#' The experiment was performed as follows:
#' A batch of pulp is produced by one of the three methods under study. Then
#' this batch is divided into four samples, and each sample is cooked at one of
#' the four temperatures. Then a second batch of pulp is made up using another
#' of the three methods. This second batch is also divided into four samples
#' that are tested at the four temperatures. The process is then repeated, until
#' all three replicates (36 runs) of the experiment are obtained.
